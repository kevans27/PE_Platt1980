Bayesian fit for the photosynthetron P-E curve model given in Platt, T., C. L. Gallegos, and W. G. Harrison. 1980. Photoinhibition of photosynthesis in natural assemblages of marine phytoplankton. Journal of Marine Research 38: 103â€“111.

Code runs in R with the package 'rstan'. Fake data is included, simply replace those lines with vectors containing your real data.

The code is Bayesian and will need priors - edit these to fit your values in lines 55-57. This can take some finangling and is greatly helped if you have an idea of what your alpha, beta, and pbs values should be.
